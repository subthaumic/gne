        id (str): The unique identifier for the vertex. Defaults to an empty string.
        weight (Optional[float]): The weight of the vertex. None if unweighted.
        children (list[Vertex]): A list of child vertices that form connections
             with this vertex to constitute simplices.

    Public Methods:
        add_child(vertex): Adds a given vertex as a child to this vertex.
        get_child(vertex): Searches for and returns a child vertex matching
                           the given vertex. Returns None if not found.
